## Workflow Patterns

[LEARN:workflow] Requirements specification phase catches ambiguity before planning → reduces rework 30-50%. Use spec-then-plan for complex/ambiguous tasks (>1 hour or >3 files).

[LEARN:workflow] Spec-then-plan protocol: AskUserQuestion (3-5 questions) → create `quality_reports/specs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md` with MUST/SHOULD/MAY requirements → declare clarity status (CLEAR/ASSUMED/BLOCKED) → get approval → then draft plan.

[LEARN:workflow] Context survival before compression: (1) Update MEMORY.md with [LEARN] entries, (2) Ensure session log current (last 10 min), (3) Active plan saved to disk, (4) Open questions documented. The pre-compact hook displays checklist.

[LEARN:workflow] Plans, specs, and session logs must live on disk (not just in conversation) to survive compression and session boundaries. Quality reports only at merge time.

## Documentation Standards

[LEARN:documentation] When adding new features, update BOTH README and guide immediately to prevent documentation drift. Stale docs break user trust.

[LEARN:documentation] Always document new templates in README's "What's Included" section with purpose description. Template inventory must be complete and accurate.

[LEARN:documentation] Guide must be generic (framework-oriented) not prescriptive. Provide templates with examples for multiple workflows (LaTeX, R, Python, Jupyter), let users customize. No "thou shalt" rules.

[LEARN:documentation] Date fields in frontmatter and README must reflect latest significant changes. Users check dates to assess currency.

## Design Philosophy

[LEARN:design] Framework-oriented > Prescriptive rules. Constitutional governance works as a TEMPLATE with examples users customize to their domain. Same for requirements specs.

[LEARN:design] Quality standard for guide additions: useful + pedagogically strong + drives usage + leaves great impression + improves upon starting fresh + no redundancy + not slow. All 7 criteria must hold.

[LEARN:design] Generic means working for any academic workflow: pure LaTeX (no Quarto), pure R (no LaTeX), Python/Jupyter, any domain (not just econometrics). Test recommendations across use cases.

## File Organization

[LEARN:files] Specifications go in `quality_reports/specs/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`, not scattered in root or other directories. Maintains structure.

[LEARN:files] Templates belong in `templates/` directory with descriptive names. Currently have: session-log.md, quality-report.md, exploration-readme.md, archive-readme.md, requirements-spec.md, constitutional-governance.md.

## Constitutional Governance

[LEARN:governance] Constitutional articles distinguish immutable principles (non-negotiable for quality/reproducibility) from flexible user preferences. Keep to 3-7 articles max.

[LEARN:governance] Example articles: Primary Artifact (which file is authoritative), Plan-First Threshold (when to plan), Quality Gate (minimum score), Verification Standard (what must pass), File Organization (where files live).

[LEARN:governance] Amendment process: Ask user if deviating from article is "amending Article X (permanent)" or "overriding for this task (one-time exception)". Preserves institutional memory.

## Skill Creation

[LEARN:skills] Effective skill descriptions use trigger phrases users actually say: "check citations", "format results", "validate protocol" → Claude knows when to load skill.

[LEARN:skills] Skills need 3 sections minimum: Instructions (step-by-step), Examples (concrete scenarios), Troubleshooting (common errors) → users can debug independently.

[LEARN:skills] Domain-specific examples beat generic ones: citation checker (psychology), protocol validator (biology), regression formatter (economics) → shows adaptability.

## Memory System

[LEARN:memory] Two-tier memory solves template vs working project tension: MEMORY.md (generic patterns, committed), personal-memory.md (machine-specific, gitignored) → cross-machine sync + local privacy.

[LEARN:memory] Post-merge hooks prompt reflection, don't auto-append → user maintains control while building habit.

## Meta-Governance

[LEARN:meta] Repository dual nature requires explicit governance: what's generic (commit) vs specific (gitignore) → prevents template pollution.

[LEARN:meta] Dogfooding principles must be enforced: plan-first, spec-then-plan, quality gates, session logs → we follow our own guide.

[LEARN:meta] Template development work (building infrastructure, docs) doesn't create session logs in quality_reports/ → those are for user work (slides, analysis), not meta-work. Keeps template clean for users who fork.

## LaTeX on Windows

[LEARN:latex] On Windows (Git Bash), TEXINPUTS path separator is `;` (semicolon), not `:` (colon). Use `TEXINPUTS="C:/path/to/Preambles;;"` — the trailing `;;` appends the standard search path. Unix-style `:` is only for Linux/macOS.

[LEARN:latex] On Windows, xelatex cannot use `cd && xelatex file.tex` pattern reliably. Use absolute paths: `xelatex -output-directory="C:/abs/path/Slides" "C:/abs/path/Slides/file.tex"`.

[LEARN:latex] Beamer `\useoutertheme{infolines}` causes `Overfull \hbox (70.75pt)` on every slide with `[aspectratio=169]`. Fix: remove `infolines` and define a custom `\setbeamertemplate{footline}` with three explicit `beamercolorbox` blocks at `.33/.34/.33\paperwidth`.

[LEARN:latex] Beamer `\newcommand{\neg}` conflicts with LaTeX's built-in `\neg` operator. Use `\negc` instead for colored negative annotation commands.

[LEARN:latex] tcolorbox `\newtcolorbox{envname}[1]{title=#1,...}` fails when titles contain commas (e.g., `Monthly data, $m=12$`) — pgfkeys treats comma as option separator. Fix: use `title={#1}` (curly braces protect comma). Affects `definitionbox` and `examplebox` in header.tex.

[LEARN:beamer] Socratic questions at bottom of dense slides: use `\muted{\footnotesize\itshape question text}` (no preceding `\vspace`) to minimize height impact while preserving pedagogical intent.

[LEARN:beamer] `\small` inside tcolorbox enumerate/itemize: wrap as `{\small \begin{enumerate}...\end{enumerate}}` — reduces the content block by ~8pt, useful for tight slides with definitionbox + columns.

[LEARN:latex] On Windows (Git Bash), the reliable xelatex compile pattern for files using `\input{../Preambles/header}` is a SHELL SCRIPT: write a .sh file with `cd "C:/Windows-style-path/Slides"` (Windows-style path, not `/c/...`) then `TEXINPUTS="../Preambles;;" xelatex file.tex`, run it with `bash script.sh`. Direct `cd /c/... && xelatex file.tex` in the Bash tool chain fails because the Windows binary xelatex sees a different CWD. For files using `\input{header}` (resolved via TEXINPUTS), use absolute-path form: `TEXINPUTS="C:/abs/Preambles;;" xelatex -output-directory="C:/abs/Slides" "C:/abs/Slides/file.tex"`. Delete the .sh script afterward.

[LEARN:pedagogy] `\sectionslide{}{}` macro must be called at every major section boundary in all lectures. It is defined in `Preambles/header.tex` (lines 230-241). When demoting section-overview keyboxes, keep the prose content as a plain paragraph in the section overview frame immediately after the `\sectionslide` call.

[LEARN:pedagogy] When splitting a dense two-column "method A vs method B" slide into two full-width slides, expand each side with: (1) `\underbrace{}` labels on formulas, (2) a muted footnote about standardization/prerequisites, (3) a worked numeric example or RSXFS finding.

[LEARN:notation] In this course, `\alpha` has multiple incompatible meanings across lectures: ETS level-smoothing (L03), ECM speed-of-adjustment (L05), EN mixing parameter (L08), EWM decay weight (L11). Any new slide using α must explicitly disambiguate from the others. The L11 EWM slide provides the gold-standard disambiguation footnote format.

[LEARN:notation] sklearn's `Ridge(alpha=...)` parameter is the PENALTY STRENGTH (what we call `lambda`). sklearn's `ElasticNet(alpha=...)` is ALSO the penalty strength. The EN mixing parameter is `l1_ratio` in sklearn, not `alpha`. Always comment: `# sklearn 'alpha' = our lambda (penalty strength)`.

[LEARN:citation] Hamilton (1994) "Time Series Analysis": Ch. 8 = OLS/Gauss-Markov (BLUE). Ch. 10 = Vector Autoregressions. Never cite Ch. 10 for OLS/BLUE results.

[LEARN:content] M4 Competition sMAPE (Makridakis et al. 2020, Table 1 overall): ES-RNN = 11.374, Theta = 11.551, FFORMA = 11.720. Theta did NOT tie with ES-RNN. Always transcribe exact values from the paper.

[LEARN:bib] ISL textbook exists in two distinct editions: ISLR2 (Applications in R, 2nd ed., 2021, 4 authors) and ISLP (Applications in Python, 1st ed., 2023, 5 authors incl. Taylor). Never mix year/edition/subtitle. For Python courses: James2021 key should use 2023, 1st ed., Python, 5 authors.

[LEARN:content] σ² = Var[ε] is irreducible noise variance. It cannot be reduced by collecting more observations from the same DGP. Never say "only better data can reduce σ²" — the irreducible floor is fixed by the data-generating process.

[LEARN:notation] In this course, p has conflicting uses: VAR lag order (L05), regression parameter count (general), polynomial degree. When discussing "too many predictors" in L07+ context, use k (parameter count) to avoid collision with L05 VAR notation.

[LEARN:pedagogy] DM test "Statistic and Mechanics" had 5 elements on one slide (d_t def, formula, asymptotic dist, H₀, HAC). Two-slide split: Slide 1 = d_t definition + numeric example; Slide 2 = full statistic with inline labels + HAC columns + warningbox.

[LEARN:pedagogy] Box fatigue ceiling: >50% of content slides with a keybox is over the ceiling. Demote motivational prose keyboxes ("always do X", "this is the closest thing to Y") to bold italic text. Reserve keybox for formal key results and decision rules.

[LEARN:latex] After a closing brace of a group (e.g., `{\small...}`), use `\vspace{Xpt}` not `\\[Xpt]` to add vertical space — the double-backslash requires a line to end and causes "There's no line here to end" error when used after a closing group brace.

[LEARN:beamer] When adding a Socratic question below a warningbox in a two-column slide: remove `\vspace{0.1cm}` before the muted question, and shorten the question text — even a single added `\vspace` + full sentence can cause vbox overflow if the column is already near capacity.

[LEARN:latex] British spelling recurring authoring pattern: "regularised/regularisation/penalised/minimises" appear in drafts. Always grep for `-ised`, `-isation`, `-ising`, `minimises`, `penalises` before finalising any lecture. Course uses American English throughout.

[LEARN:notation] `\alpha` disambiguation must appear at FIRST USE in each lecture, not deferred to later sections. Course has 4 conflicting uses: ETS smoothing (L03), ECM adjustment (L05), EN mixing (L08), attention weights (L10). Pattern: `\muted{\footnotesize\itshape $\alpha$ here = [this use] --- distinct from [L03 use], [L05 use], [L08 use].}`

[LEARN:citation] `\parencite` inside tcolorbox titles (definitionbox/examplebox) and `\sectionslide` arguments is fragile (biblatex/hyperref interaction). Always put citations in box bodies as `\muted{\footnotesize\parencite{key}}`. For `\sectionslide`, citations already appear in the subsequent content slide.

[LEARN:beamer] Moving an inline `\frac{}{}` to display math (`\[...\]`) can cause 40pt+ vbox overflow on a dense Beamer slide. Fix: use `\tfrac` instead of `\frac` in display mode, add `\vspace{-6pt}` before and after the equation, and set `\footnotesize` on the enclosing box/column content.

[LEARN:pedagogy] Section overview keybox frames should ALWAYS be replaced with `\sectionslide{Title}{Subtitle}` (defined in header.tex). The subtitle captures the section's core thesis. Removing 6-7 section-overview keyboxes can drop deck-level keybox density from ~54% to ~29%, resolving Pattern 10 (box fatigue) simultaneously.

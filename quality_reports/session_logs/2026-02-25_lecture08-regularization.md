# Session Log: Lecture 08 — Regularization
**Date:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Lecture:** `Slides/Lecture08_Regularization.tex` + `scripts/Lecture08_Regularization.ipynb`

---

## Goal

Create Lecture 08 (Regularization: LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net) as a full first draft —
the full treatment of penalized regression following the preview in L07.

---

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Section ordering: Ridge → LASSO → Elastic Net | Pedagogically natural: closed-form first, then more complex. Ridge motivates the penalty idea; LASSO adds sparsity; Elastic Net generalizes. |
| Constraint-set geometry diagrams in TikZ | Visual intuition for why LASSO is sparse (diamond corners) and Ridge is not (circle). Hardcoded coordinates — no `\pgfmathsetmacro`. |
| Coefficient paths drawn schematically (TikZ, not pgfplots) | Ridge path is smooth (Bézier curves); LASSO path is piecewise-linear (straight segments). Both are schematic, not from data — avoids pgfplots complexity on slides. |
| α notation note added to Elastic Net section | α in Elastic Net = L1/L2 mix; α in ETS = smoothing parameter. Cross-lecture collision flagged explicitly for students. |
| sklearn pipeline with StandardScaler inside CV | Prevents leakage; pedagogically correct. Shown as full `lstlisting` code block in [fragile] frame. |
| Comparison table: illustrative RMSE values (not real) | RSXFS results vary with sample period; illustrative values labeled clearly. Notebook produces real results. |

## Compilation Issues Encountered and Resolved

### Issue 1: `\end{frame>` typos (5 instances)
**Cause:** Typos in initial file write — `>` instead of `}` at frame endings.
**Fix:** Corrected all 5 instances before first compile.

### Issue 2: Duplicate `Tibshirani1996` bib entry
**Cause:** `Tibshirani1996` was already in `Bibliography_base.bib` (added for L07 or earlier).
My session added a second copy.
**Fix:** Removed the second copy. The original (line 128) was retained.

### Issue 3: Overfull `\hbox` (21.45pt) — TimeSeriesSplit CV frame
**Cause:** TikZ time axis with `xscale=0.56` extended to x=11.3; with the `node[right]{time}`
annotation the total width exceeded the 0.44\textwidth right column.
**Fix:** Reduced `xscale` from 0.56 to 0.46 and changed `node[right]` to `node[above]`
so the label doesn't extend beyond the arrow tip.
**[LEARN:latex] TimeSeriesSplit TikZ in a narrow (0.44\\textwidth) column: use xscale ≤ 0.47 and place "time" label above the arrow, not to the right.**

## Quality Review Findings and Fixes Applied

### MAJOR
1. **$z_j$ called "partial residual correlation"** — factually wrong; it is the partial
   residual inner product (not normalized).
   **Fix:** `"$z_j = \mathbf{x}_j^\top(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X}_{-j}\hat{\bm{\beta}}_{-j})$ is
   the partial residual inner product for predictor $j$."`

2. **`X_train` → `X_trainval` in lstlisting** — the coefficient inspection code referenced
   `X_train` (undefined in slide snippet) instead of `X_trainval` (the fitted data).
   Would cause `NameError` if students ran the code verbatim.
   **Fix:** Changed to `X_trainval.columns.tolist()`.

3. **α notation collision** — α used for L1/L2 mixing (Elastic Net) conflicts with
   level-smoothing α from Lecture 03 (ETS).
   **Fix:** Added muted note: "α here is the L1/L2 mixing parameter, distinct from ETS α."

4. **Duplicate `Zou2005` bib entry** — `Zou2005` (pre-existing) and `ZouHastie2005` (new)
   were both the same paper. Removed orphan `Zou2005` key.

### MINOR (all fixed)
5. **British → American spelling** — "regularised/isation/generalisation/standardised/
   minimises" → American equivalents throughout (6 instances).
6. **Socratic grammar** — "(Answer next section.)" → "(Answered in the next section.)"
7. **Informal phrasing** — "that is data leakage" → "this constitutes data leakage".

### Not fixed (deferred)
- Issue 4 (soft-thresholding λ/2 vs λ convention note): The formula is internally consistent with
  the loss convention used in the slides (no 1/2 scaling). A footnote clarifying the convention
  difference with ESL would be valuable but was deferred to avoid slide crowding.
- Issue 5 (table column widths): Compilation produced 0 overflows — the table fits. No action taken.
- Issue 15 (Socratic question 2 phrasing): Minor stylistic concern; retained as is.

## [LEARN] Entries

- `[LEARN:latex] TimeSeriesSplit TikZ in 0.44\\textwidth column: xscale ≤ 0.47; place "time" axis label above arrow (not right) to prevent overfull.`
- `[LEARN:content] z_j in LASSO coordinate descent = partial residual inner product, NOT correlation. Correlation implies normalization.`
- `[LEARN:content] α notation collision: Elastic Net mix parameter α (L07-L08) conflicts with ETS smoothing α (L03). Add explicit notation note in Elastic Net section.`
- `[LEARN:bib] Check for pre-existing bib entries before adding new ones — Tibshirani1996 and Zou2005 were already in the file.`

## Pedagogy Review + Fixes (2026-02-28)

**Report:** `quality_reports/Lecture08_Regularization_pedagogy_report.md`
**Score:** 8/13 followed, 3/13 violated, 2/13 partially applied

### Fixes Applied

| # | Severity | Fix |
|---|----------|-----|
| 1 | HIGH | Inserted `\sectionslide{}{}` at all 6 section boundaries (before lines 32, 133, 288, 454, 548, 685) + demoted 6 Section Overview keyboxes to plain text |
| 2 | HIGH | Added `# sklearn 'alpha' = our lambda (penalty strength)` comment before `param_grid` in Pipeline code |
| 3 | MEDIUM | Extended α disambiguation note to include Lecture 05 ECM α (speed-of-adjustment) |
| 4 | MEDIUM | Added compact soft-thresholding worked example (`z_j=1.8 → β̂=0.8`; `z_j=0.7 → β̂=0`) in footnotesize |

**Overflow from Fix 4:** LASSO slide overflowed by 6.57pt. Fixed by: removing `\medskip` → `\smallskip` before coordinate descent text, tightening the `z_j` definition to one line, compressing the worked example to a single inline `\footnotesize` line.

**Final state (2026-02-28):** 34 pages (+6 sectionslide frames), 0 errors, 0 overflows.

### Deferred
- 3rd Socratic question (Low): Validation curve slide — "when would the one-SE rule backfire?"
- Standardization `warningbox` on Ridge properties slide (Low)
- `X_trainval` forward-pointer to L11 in Pipeline code (Low)
